<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Why did the man of God listen to the old prophet and not God? What could the man of God have done to discern what the old prophet shared with him? What can we learn from this episode concerning the disobedience of God’s instructions?</li>
  <li>What was Jeroboam’s posture when he heard God’s words from the prophet (vv 1-6)? What about his subsequent heart posture in verses 33-34? Why do we so easily return to our sinful ways despite having encountered the reality of God?</li>
</ol>

<p>This week, we approach the final parts of Solomon’s reflections in Proverbs. Then we continue our exploration into the history of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel. We uncover one common theme when we examine the various kings – if they walk in God’s ways, all will be well for them. If they forsake the Lord, they end up in a place of destruction and judgment. May we learn from their examples and walk in God’s ways at all times!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>The mark of a growing disciple is the discipline to self-feed. During this unprecedented time, the Lord is redirecting His people to pause and rediscover Him and His ways afresh. This is the heart behind our Bible Reading Plan - that we, as a church will delight the Father when we are growing in our love for Him and allowing His Spirit to move us in obeying His Word in our lives.</p>

<p>The Bible Reading Plan comprises a daily passage with reflection questions to guide you in meditation. You can also journal what God’s Spirit is prompting you to do in applying the Word. We pray that as you carve out unhurried time to encounter God, you will revitalise your spiritual life and encourage others to experience likewise!</p>
