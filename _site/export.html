<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>This week, we keep at the narratives of the book of Kings and see how king after king did evil in the sight of the Lord. They continued to be unfaithful to the covenant and lead the people to transgress the law by instituting idolatry. Many prophets were sent by God to warn the kings (including Elijah), but they remained unrepentant. As such, judgment came upon them. As we read through the pages of Scripture, may we take to heart that God desires His people to stay faithful to Him.</p>

  <li>In 1 Kings 17:2-3, God led Elijah to a period of hiding by the Brook Cherith. Cherith means “cut off or cut down.” Why did God ask Elijah to do so? Recall an experience in your life when God prompted you to “hide in Him”</li>

  <li>In ancient times, the people had to satisfy the gods (Baal) in order to have material wellbeing. Examine your motive in approaching God – do you sometimes go to God so that you will be blessed or have your prayer answered? What needs to change when you approach God?</li>

  <li>When Ahab made a covenant with Ben-Hadad, he made himself higher than God. He determined what to do with the spoils of war and ignored God’s instructions (v 42). Scrutinise and identify areas of your life where you are still in-charge and not God.</li>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We look at the ministry of Elisha, the successor of the great Elijah. From the readings, we will see miracle after miracle being performed by Elisha. This is testament to the fact that the God of the Bible is a miracle-working God. Our God is a God of miracles to Israel and Judah… and He still is today to us, and forever He will be. As you read through the passages, may your hearts be lifted up to the God of miracles.</p>

  <li>King Jehosaphat “did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.” Examine the various areas of your life. Which area(s) require of you to “do what is right in the eyes of the Lord” even when it is unpopular with those around you? What does it mean specifically in each area?

<p>This week, we approach the final parts of Solomon’s reflections in Proverbs. Then we continue our exploration into the history of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel. We uncover one common theme when we examine the various kings – if they walk in God’s ways, all will be well for them. If they forsake the Lord, they end up in a place of destruction and judgment. May we learn from their examples and walk in God’s ways at all times!</p>

<h2 id="this-weeks-focus">This Week’s Focus</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>This week, we will explore the final chapters of Solomon’s end-of-life reflections in the book of Ecclesiastes. His conclusion for mankind is this – Fear God and keep His commandments… (Ecc. 12:13-14). The fear of the Lord is one topic that is hardly talked about in churches today. Many prefer to focus on the love and grace of God. Solomon, however reminds us of a coming reality that we will all stand before God who will judge us at the end of days. May the Lord ignite in you a desire to live for that which is eternal and not temporal!</p>

<p>The mark of a growing disciple is the discipline to self-feed. During this unprecedented time, the Lord is redirecting His people to pause and rediscover Him and His ways afresh. This is the heart behind our Bible Reading Plan - that we, as a church will delight the Father when we are growing in our love for Him and allowing His Spirit to move us in obeying His Word in our lives.</p>

<p>The Bible Reading Plan comprises a daily passage with reflection questions to guide you in meditation. You can also journal what God’s Spirit is prompting you to do in applying the Word. We pray that as you carve out unhurried time to encounter God, you will revitalise your spiritual life and encourage others to experience likewise!</p>
