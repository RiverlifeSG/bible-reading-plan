<h2 id="this-weeks-focus">This Week’s Focus</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We come to the end of exploring how the nation of Israel landed up in exile. God’s Word through the prophet Micah was a warning to the idolatrous nation to turn from her ways. But sadly, Israel continued in her sin. As you read through the passages this week, may your spiritual ears be open to listen to God’s still small voice – calling you back to Him, especially those areas in your life that you have yet to surrender to Him.</p>

  <li>Verse 27 illustrates God’s faithfulness to His promises. Are there any prerequisites for us to receive all of God’s promises in His Word? (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+1%3A3-8&amp;version=ESV">Joshua 1:3-8</a>)</li>

<ol>
  <li>For every King that “did evil in the eyes of the Lord”, what was the common phrase that Scripture uses to describe what they did? Can you identify any unhealthy / sinful pattern(s) that have been passed down from previous generations in your family tree? Take some time to repent of these sinful patterns before the Lord. (see also “Understanding the Generational Curse of Exodus 34:7” in Additional Resources).</li>
  <li>Very little was recorded about many of these kings as they had minimal impact on their kingdom. Identify 3 persons in your life that you would intentionally like to impact. Describe how you would like to do so.</li>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We look at the ministry of Elisha, the successor of the great Elijah. From the readings, we will see miracle after miracle being performed by Elisha. This is testament to the fact that the God of the Bible is a miracle-working God. Our God is a God of miracles to Israel and Judah… and He still is today to us, and forever He will be. As you read through the passages, may your hearts be lifted up to the God of miracles.</p>

<p>We continue to trace the history of Israel and Judah during the times of the divided kingdom. One theme emerges from this week’s reading – God’s promises. It always comes to pass. Every prophecy spoken over the various kings of Israel and Judah came to pass. Every promise of God spoken over His people came to pass. Why? That’s who God is - He is a faithful God and our God does not lie. May your hearts be encouraged this week by the God who keeps all of His promises!</p>

<p>This week, we approach the final parts of Solomon’s reflections in Proverbs. Then we continue our exploration into the history of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel. We uncover one common theme when we examine the various kings – if they walk in God’s ways, all will be well for them. If they forsake the Lord, they end up in a place of destruction and judgment. May we learn from their examples and walk in God’s ways at all times!</p>

<p>We continue our examination of the proclamation of God’s judgement on the nations of Israel through the prophets Isaiah and Hosea.

  <li>Verses 1-9 show Israel’s failure to see the connection between an action and its consequences, and Israel’s refusal to recognise the boundaries set by God. Personal freedom is a right held firmly by many people today. As a believer, how firmly should we hold onto our personal freedom? (see also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A23-24&amp;version=ESV">1 Corinthians 10:23-24</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A31-33&amp;version=ESV">31-33</a>)</li>
  <li>Verses 10-29 deal with the human tendency to use religious behaviour as a means of manipulating God for our own benefit. How then should we come before God in prayer for our needs?

<p>We continue our exploration of the Psalms of Ascent before embarking on a study of 1 Peter, in line with our pulpit series. As you read through the Psalms this week, may you observe the various postures that we should have as we approach God in worship. Our worship of God must be an outflow of a life that fears Him and walks in His ways.</p>

  <li>Jesus’s standard of a disciple is a high one (verse 62). What does it mean to “put one’s hand into the plow and look back”? Why do you think this person is not fit for the kingdom of God?</li>
  <li>Jesus spells out clearly to all who want to follow Him – it is going to be a tough journey involving much sacrifice. What are some dreams / goals / wants you have in your life which you are still struggling to lay at the foot of the cross?</li>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We will finish our study of King Hezekiah’s reign before reading the Psalms of Ascent (Psalm 120-134). These psalms were sung by the Jewish worshippers as they headed up to Jerusalem for the 3 pilgrim festivals (Deuteronomy 16:16). Imagine being in exile and unable to go to Jerusalem as the temple was destroyed. That was what Israel experienced during their years of exile. Doesn’t that mirror our COVID-19 situation today? As you read these Psalms, may God grant you a greater appreciation for the gathering of the body of Christ each Sunday!</p>

  <li>When Israel was in exile and the temple was destroyed, the Jews could not go to Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts of God. Thus, Psalm 122 became a lamentation. During this COVID-19 season when we are unable to gather physically as a church, what do you miss about “going to church”?</li>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>This week, we will explore the final chapters of Solomon’s end-of-life reflections in the book of Ecclesiastes. His conclusion for mankind is this – Fear God and keep His commandments… (Ecc. 12:13-14). The fear of the Lord is one topic that is hardly talked about in churches today. Many prefer to focus on the love and grace of God. Solomon, however reminds us of a coming reality that we will all stand before God who will judge us at the end of days. May the Lord ignite in you a desire to live for that which is eternal and not temporal!</p>

<h2 id="this-weeks-focus">This Week’s Focus</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>This week, we keep at the narratives of the book of Kings and see how king after king did evil in the sight of the Lord. They continued to be unfaithful to the covenant and lead the people to transgress the law by instituting idolatry. Many prophets were sent by God to warn the kings (including Elijah), but they remained unrepentant. As such, judgment came upon them. As we read through the pages of Scripture, may we take to heart that God desires His people to stay faithful to Him.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In 1 Kings 17:2-3, God led Elijah to a period of hiding by the Brook Cherith. Cherith means “cut off or cut down.” Why did God ask Elijah to do so? Recall an experience in your life when God prompted you to “hide in Him”</li>

  <li>Can God always be counted on to intervene in our world during a crisis? If so, how does he intervene? If not, how can He still be considered trustworthy?</li>
  <li>In ancient times, the people had to satisfy the gods (Baal) in order to have material wellbeing. Examine your motive in approaching God – do you sometimes go to God so that you will be blessed or have your prayer answered? What needs to change when you approach God?</li>

  <li>When Ahab made a covenant with Ben-Hadad, he made himself higher than God. He determined what to do with the spoils of war and ignored God’s instructions (v 42). Scrutinise and identify areas of your life where you are still in-charge and not God.</li>

  <li>Verse 17-19 tell us that God is aware of everything that happened, and He judged Ahab and Jezebel for their misdeeds.

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>The mark of a growing disciple is the discipline to self-feed. During this unprecedented time, the Lord is redirecting His people to pause and rediscover Him and His ways afresh. This is the heart behind our Bible Reading Plan - that we, as a church will delight the Father when we are growing in our love for Him and allowing His Spirit to move us in obeying His Word in our lives.</p>

<p>The Bible Reading Plan comprises a daily passage with reflection questions to guide you in meditation. You can also journal what God’s Spirit is prompting you to do in applying the Word. We pray that as you carve out unhurried time to encounter God, you will revitalise your spiritual life and encourage others to experience likewise!</p>
