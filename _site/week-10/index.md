# WEEK 10

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.png)

We will close on the book of Ezra and embark on the post-Davidic history of Israel, beginning with Solomon. Understanding this history will provide us with a greater appreciation of the events in the books of Nehemiah and Ezra. Our first pit stop is the book of Ecclesiastes. The phrase, “Vanity, vanity…” will echo throughout the book as Solomon challenges us on how everything in this life and in this world is meaningless apart from a relationship with God. As you read through Solomon’s words, may it rouse you to live a God-centred life and may you always remember that this world is not your home\!

<u>NOTE</u>: We recommend you watch “Overview – Ecclesiastes” in the Additional Resources before you start reading the book of Ecclesiastes.

### Today’s Meditation

## Thursday

```
“Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness. The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.” – Ecclesiastes 2:13-14 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ecclesiastes 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+2&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Solomon wrote that pleasure, wisdom and folly, and toil are all meaningless. Evaluate each of these – why can they be meaningless?

2. Reflect on vv 17-23. How then should we as Christians approach our work? (Refer also to [Colossians 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A23&version=ESV), [John 6:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A27&version=ESV), [1 Timothy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+5%3A8&version=ESV) [5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+5%3A8&version=ESV))

## FRIDAY

```
“I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.” – Ecclesiastes 3:14 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ecclesiastes 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. In the Hebrew language, verses 2-8 was intentionally written poetically to show the monotony of all things, rather than their variety (a time… a time… a time…). It reminds us of the inevitability of trouble and evil, and of the relentless monotony of life. As Christ followers, what then should our posture be in light of the inevitability of trouble and evil?

2. Verse 11 says that God “has also set eternity in the human heart”. What does that mean for you in this transient world? How can we live with an eternal perspective?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

June 27

## Saturday

```
“But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up\!” - Ecclesiastes 4:10 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ecclesiastes 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+4&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Amidst Solomon’s lament of the vanity in various aspects of life, he takes a rare turn and praises one aspect of life that is worth investing in – relationships. Why is investing in an intimate spiritual friendship so important for one’s life?

2. “…a threefold cord is not quickly broken” (v 12). Identify two relationships that you would like to invest in. How can you keep this relationship God-centred? How can you spur each other to grow in your faith?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Sunday

```
“He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.” - Ecclesiastes 5:10 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ecclesiastes 5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+5-6&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. “All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.” (v 6:7) In chapters 5-6 Solomon deals with the vanity of wealth and materialism. What are some reasons he gives for the vanity of wealth and materialism?

2. In view of Solomon’s reflection on money, how then should we live as Christians? What is the right posture for us to have towards wealth and abundance? (Refer to [Hebrews 13:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A5&version=ESV), [Matthew 6:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A19-21&version=ESV), [1 Timothy 6:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A17&version=ESV), [1 John 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A17&version=ESV))
