This week, we begin our reading of Nehemiah and deal with one of the themes highlighted in this book – sin and brokenness. After this first reading, we will examine the theme of sin and brokenness in greater detail and what Scripture teaches about it.

## Monday

```
“When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.” - Nehemiah 1:4 (NIV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+1&version=NIV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Put yourself in Nehemiah’s shoes. Why would an individual who was born in exile respond the way he did to the news of Jerusalem’s ruins? What are some possible factors leading to Nehemiah’s reaction?
2. As you look at our society today, what do you think are some things that break the heart of God? Rather than turning a blind eye to these things, how can you pray and stand in the gap on behalf of those who cannot tell between right and wrong?

1. Read [Genesis 6:5-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+6%3A5-22&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Examine verses 5-6. Why do you think the great God of the universe was grieved to His heart by the sins of men? Shouldn’t this be an expected outcome as a result of the sin of Adam?
2. Noah took 120 years to build the ark before he saw the first drop of rain. As a result of his obedience, he found favour in God’s eyes. What areas in your life at this point of time require obedience?

1. Read [Psalm 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+11&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

2. Verse 7 states that, “...the Lord is righteous.” Why do you think the Lord hates sin so much? What implication does it have on how we should live?

## Sunday

```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Psalm 103](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. This Psalm begins and ends with a call to worship - to bless the Lord. The rest of the Psalm gives us the reason why. What are the characteristics of God listed in this Psalm that will cause us to worship Him?
2. This Psalm states that “the Lord does not deal with us according to our sin.” This is grace. Remember the times in your life when you have disappointed God through sin. Contrast that with the characteristics of God you just listed. Then, write a prayer to God thanking Him for His grace.
