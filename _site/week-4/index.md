# Week 4

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.jpg)

We begin another theme - suffering - as we see how opposition continues to rise against Nehemiah. But more importantly, we see Nehemiah’s response to these oppositions. Oppositions and suffering for doing right is a subject that affects many of us, albeit some more than others.

Jesus himself warned us that we will have “tribulation” (John 16:33) in this world. Having a right perspective and response towards suffering is crucial for a believer. As you go through the various passages this week, may the Word of God shape your worldview on this theme so that your response towards suffering will be one that brings glory to His name!

## Monday

```
“... and since we have a great priest over the house of God...” - Hebrews 10:21 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Hebrews 10:19-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A19-25&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. What does it mean that “we have a great priest over the house of God” (v 21)? How does this allow us to draw near to God “with a true heart in full assurance of faith” (v 22)?

2. Why is it so important for us to “encourage one another… as we see the Day approaching”? In the context of a cell, how can we encourage one another?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Tuesday

```
“What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?” - Nehemiah 5:9 (NIV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+5&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Nehemiah observed that there was oppression against the poor and he proceeded to address this problem and the people responded accordingly. What do you think would have happened if the people refused to change their ways?

2. “Yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor… Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.” (v 19) Examine your desires and motivations – do you live for the audience of One, like Nehemiah did?

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Psalms 22:1-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+22%3A1-31&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. David, the man after God’s own heart, was going through a period of suffering. In this Psalm, he presents his complaints before the Lord, but he also remembers who God is. List the characteristics of God contained in this Psalm that David chooses to remember in the midst of his suffering. Take some time to meditate on these characteristics and how they relate to your own life.

2. The Biblical way of bringing our sorrows before the Lord is not just to pour out to Him about our situation and let out our emotions, but to also remember and declare who He is in the midst of it all. Write out your version of Psalm 22 - describing your situation as well as remembering who God is.

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Psalms 53:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+53&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. What does verse 3 tell you about the state of man? How then should we live before God if “there is no one good”? Consider Romans 8:12-17 in the light of verse 3.

2. “There is none who does good…” (v 3). How will this affect the suffering in the world today?
