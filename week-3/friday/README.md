### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A16-33&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 16:16-33</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. “You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy…” (v 20). What do you think Jesus meant when He said this to His disciples?
2. “I have overcome the world…” (v 33). How does this verse apply to you and your circumstances?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
