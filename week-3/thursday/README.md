### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+29%3A1-23&version=ESV" target="_blank">Jeremiah 29:1-23</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. “And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile…” (v 7, NLT). While waiting for God’s rescue to come, how are you to approach your current season of exile/difficulty?
2. Jeremiah 29:11-14 describes God’s heart for His chidlren. In light of understanding His heart, what are some of your attitudes that need to change in the midst of difficulties?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
