### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+18%3A1-11&version=ESV" target="_blank">Acts 18:1-11</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Why do you think God needed to tell Paul not to be afraid (v 9)?
2. God knows when to best encourage us. Therefore, what should your posture be during the period of silence (the absence of God’s voice)?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
