# Week 3

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.jpg)

We ended last week by seeing how Nehemiah and Judah prevailed against those who oppose their work of rebuilding the walls. Opposition is to be expected every time we walk in obedience to God’s ways and commands. At times, the journey can be tough and we all need encouragement from fellow brothers and sisters as we enter by the narrow gate. This week, we will explore the theme of encouragement.

We will look to God’s Word concerning encouragement and how His Word can encourage us when the going gets tough.

## Monday

```
“Be strong and courageous...” - Deuteronomy 31:7 (ESV)
