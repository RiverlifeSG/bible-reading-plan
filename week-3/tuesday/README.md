### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+27&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 27</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Recall an incident when you applied this promise of God - “He will hide me in His shelter in the day of trouble?” (v 5)
2. Meditate on verse 13 – I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (NKJV). What does this verse mean personally for you?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
