### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+35%3A1-10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Isaiah 35:1-10</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. “Be strong; fear not!.... He will come and save you. (v 4)” What does it personally mean to you knowing that God will save us in the midst of our mess?
2. Verse 8 says that God delivers us so that we can walk on the “highway of holiness.” Examine your heart and your thoughts – is the desire of your heart to walk in the way of holiness when God rescues you?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
