### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31%3A7-8&version=ESV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 31:7–8</a>
2. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+31%3A23&version=ESV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>
3. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+1%3A1-9&version=ESV" target="_blank">Joshua 1:1-9</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go (v 9b). Place yourself in Joshua’s shoes. Why is it important for you to hear this?
2. Think about an opposition or a discouragement you are experiencing. What does it mean for you to be “strong and courageous” in this/these situation(s)?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
