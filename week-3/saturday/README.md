### Reflection Questions
1. What is something important that Paul did to strengthen the churches? (v 22)
2. Who is one person you can encourage during this season that is going through a tough time? Spend some time in prayer and work out an action plan on how to encourage this individual.


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
