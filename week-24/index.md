## This Week’s Focus

The focus shifts from submission to the civil authorities over us, to submission within the family unit. God’s desire is for every family to thrive. Imagine what the church would look like if every family was not just surviving, but thriving! Through the passages this week, may you be challenged to play your part as outlined in God’s blueprint for the family! Family is big on God’s heart.
