# Week 13

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

This week, we keep at the narratives of the book of Kings and see how king after king did evil in the sight of the Lord. They continued to be unfaithful to the covenant and lead the people to transgress the law by instituting idolatry. Many prophets were sent by God to warn the kings (including Elijah), but they remained unrepentant. As such, judgment came upon them. As we read through the pages of Scripture, may we take to heart that God desires His people to stay faithful to Him.



## Monday

```
“He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.” – 1 Kings 15:34 (ESV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 15:33-16:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+15%3A33-16%3A34&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. The passage today reveals the multiplying effect of spiritual decay of Israel from Baasha to Ahab. Notice how the author evaluates each king. What are the similarities and differences between each king?
2. The passage before us today shows how critical it is for a nation to have good leaders. As we have just elected the government, would you write out a short prayer for Singapore below?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Tuesday

```
“Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.” – 1 Kings 17:24 (NIV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+17&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. In 1 Kings 17:2-3, God led Elijah to a period of hiding by the Brook Cherith. Cherith means “cut off or cut down.” Why did God ask Elijah to do so? Recall an experience in your life when God prompted you to “hide in Him”
2. As you consider the woman’s actions and her subsequent testimony recorded in 1 Kings 17:24, what principle(s) can you learn about knowing the truth of God’s words? What does it reveal about who God is?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Wednesday

```
“How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal is God, follow him.” – 1 Kings 18:21 (NIV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+18&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Can God always be counted on to intervene in our world during a crisis? If so, how does he intervene? If not, how can He still be considered trustworthy?
2. In ancient times, the people had to satisfy the gods (Baal) in order to have material wellbeing. Examine your motive in approaching God – do you sometimes go to God so that you will be blessed or have your prayer answered? What needs to change when you approach God?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Thursday

```
“After the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.” – 1 Kings 19:12 (NIV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+19&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. What is the significance of the order in how God appeared to Elijah – wind, earthquake, fire, and still small voice? Why is it important to know God in the still small voice?
2. How do you remind yourself that God is in control when you are in the middle of difficult circumstances?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Friday

```
“Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand this day, and you shall know that I am the Lord.” – 1 Kings 20:13 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+20&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. After defeating Ben-Hadad’s army in the mountains, Ahab’s forces defeated them again in the plains. What is God’s reason? Why is this important?
2. When Ahab made a covenant with Ben-Hadad, he made himself higher than God. He determined what to do with the spoils of war and ignored God’s instructions (v 42). Scrutinise and identify areas of your life where you are still in-charge and not God. 

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Saturday

```
“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son’s days I will bring the disaster upon his house.” - 1 Kings 21:29 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+21&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Verse 17-19 tell us that God is aware of everything that happened, and He judged Ahab and Jezebel for their misdeeds. What comfort can you find in knowing that God will one day bring justice on the earth and avenge His people? (See [Galatians 6:7-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A7-10&version=ESV))
2. The story of Naboth reminds us that God is against social injustices. What are some social injustices that exist in Singapore? How can we as believers make a difference?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Sunday

```
“As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak.” - 1 Kings 22:14 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 22:1-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+22%3A1-39&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Compare the attitude of Ahab with that of Jehoshaphat in regard to seeking counsel of the LORD. In what way did they both err? 
2. Why would someone totally ignore God’s revealed will and do whatever he or she wants? How can we conduct our lives in such a way that we are not expecting God to “rubber stamp” all our goals and desires? (See [Matthew 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A21-23&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
