# Week 15

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We continue to trace the history of Israel and Judah during the times of the divided kingdom. One theme emerges from this week’s reading – God’s promises. It always comes to pass. Every prophecy spoken over the various kings of Israel and Judah came to pass. Every promise of God spoken over His people came to pass. Why? That’s who God is - He is a faithful God and our God does not lie. May your hearts be encouraged this week by the God who keeps all of His promises!



## Monday

```
