# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

This week, we approach the final parts of Solomon’s reflections in Proverbs. Then we continue our exploration into the history of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel. We uncover one common theme when we examine the various kings – if they walk in God’s ways, all will be well for them. If they forsake the Lord, they end up in a place of destruction and judgment. May we learn from their examples and walk in God’s ways at all times!
