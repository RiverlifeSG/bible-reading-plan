# Sunday

```
“Nevertheless, for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem, because David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.” - 1 Kings 15:4-5 (ESV)

## Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 15:1-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+15%3A1-32&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. What were the actions taken by Asa in verses 11-14? How did the Bible describe his heart? Following the example of Asa, what “reforms” do you need to make in your life so that your life is right before the Lord?
2. Did the kings of Israel - Nadab and Baasha do right in the eyes of the Lord? When reading about these kings, what key lesson can we draw from their examples? How can that be applied to your life?

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
