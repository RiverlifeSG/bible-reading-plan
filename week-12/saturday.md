# Saturday

```
“I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept My commands and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes.” - 1 Kings 14:8 (NIV)

## Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings+14&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. Jeroboam was not from the line of David but was chosen to lead 10 of the 12 tribes. What was God’s evaluation of Jeroboam’s reign as communicated through the prophet Ahijah? What finally happened to him and his family?
2. How was Judah under the reign of Rehoboam? What happened to Rehoboam and the Kingdom of Judah? What lessons can we learn about God from His dealings with Judah during the reign of Rehoboam? 

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
