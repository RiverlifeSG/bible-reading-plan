# Thursday

```
“So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.” – 1 Kings 12:15 (NIV)

## Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings+12&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. What were the advices of the elders and the young men to Rehoboam in response to the people’s worries? Which did he choose? How can we learn from Rehoboam’s example when making decisions?
2. What did Jeroboam do as a result of his insecurity and fear (vv 26- 29)? Reflect on a time when you chose to depend on your wisdom rather than God’s Word. Were there similarities between yourself and Jeroboam? How can that be avoided in the future?

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
