## Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings+13&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. Why did the man of God listen to the old prophet and not God? What could the man of God have done to discern what the old prophet shared with him? What can we learn from this episode concerning the disobedience of God’s instructions?
2. What was Jeroboam’s posture when he heard God’s words from the prophet (vv 1-6)? What about his subsequent heart posture in verses 33-34? Why do we so easily return to our sinful ways despite having encountered the reality of God?

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
