## Today's Meditation
1. Read [Proverbs 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+2&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. What is promised to those who seek wisdom?
2. What does wisdom save us from? What is the outcome of following wisdom?

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
