## Today's Meditation
1. Read [Proverbs 1:8-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+1%3A8-33&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. Proverbs 1 warns about interacting with sinful men. From verse 19, what is their motivation, and what happens to those who associate with them?
2. What happens to those who ignore the call of wisdom? What happens to those who heed that call?

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
