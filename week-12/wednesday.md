## Today's Meditation
1. Read [Proverbs 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3&version=ESV)


## Reflection Questions
1. What does “do not be wise in your own eyes” (v 7) mean for you? What are the rewards of fearing the Lord (v 8)?
2. We are advised to trust in God (vv 5-6) and also to give Him our first fruits in (vv 9-10). From verses 11-12, what else can a believer expect? How are we to respond to it?

## Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
