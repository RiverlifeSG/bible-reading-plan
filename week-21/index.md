# Week 21

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

In line with 1 Peter sermon series, we will deal with the topic of holiness – what does it mean to live holy lives. We are to be holy, because God is holy and we are His ambassadors here on this earth. We reveal God’s holiness to the world in our everyday lives through our speech, our deeds, the way we live and how we relate to others. As you read through these passages, may you realise the impact you make when you live a holy life each day as sojourners in this world.



## Monday

```
“I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think...” - Romans 12:3 (ESV
