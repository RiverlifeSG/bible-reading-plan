### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+53%3A1-12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalms 53:1-12</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. What does verse 3 tell you about the state of man? How then should we live before God if “there is no one good”? Consider Romans 8:12-17 in the light of verse 3.
2. “There is none who does good…” (v 3). How will this affect the suffering in the world today?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
