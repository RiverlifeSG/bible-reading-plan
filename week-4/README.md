# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We begin another theme - suffering - as we see how opposition continues to rise against Nehemiah. But more importantly, we see Nehemiah’s response to theseoppositions. Oppositions and suffering for doing right is a subject that affects many of us, albeit some more than others.

Jesus himself warned us that we will have “tribulation” (John 16:33) in this world. Having a right perspective and response towards suffering is crucial for a believer. As you go through the various passages this week, may the Word of God shape your worldview on this theme so that your response towards suffering will be one that brings glory to His name!
