### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+6-7%3A3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 6-7:3</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. The onslaught of opposition to the building of the wall continued even though Nehemiah did everything that was pleasing in the eyes of God. Meditate on verse 14. What was Nehemiah’s posture towards his enemies?
2. Think of 3 persons that may “cause your blood pressure to rise.” How can you have a God-honouring posture towards them and yet not be trampled on?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
