### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+9%3A1-7&version=ESV" target="_blank">John 9:1-7</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. According to verse 3, what is the ultimate purpose of our suffering? What does it mean that “the works of God might be displayed in Him”?
2. Our suffering is not always the consequence of our actions. However, how we respond to it matters. What are some things you can do in the midst of your suffering so that God is glorified? (v 3)


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
