### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 5</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Nehemiah observed that there was oppression against the poor and he proceeded to address this problem and the people responded accordingly. What do you think would have happened if the people refused to change their ways?
2. “Yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor… Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.” (v 19) Examine your desires and motivations – do you live for the audience of One, like Nehemiah did?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
