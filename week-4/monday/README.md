### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A19-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:19-25</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. What does it mean that “we have a great priest over the house of God” (v 21)? How does this allow us to draw near to God “with a true heart in full assurance of faith” (v 22)?
2. Why is it so important for us to “encourage one another as we see the Day approaching”? In the context of a cell, how can we encourage one another?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
