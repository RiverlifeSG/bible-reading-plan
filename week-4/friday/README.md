### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+22%3A1-31&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalms 22:1-31</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. David, the man after God’s own heart, was going through a period of suffering. In this Psalm, he presents his complaints before the Lord, but he also remembers who God is. List the characteristics of God contained in this Psalm that David chooses to remember in the midst of his suffering. Take some time to meditate on these characteristics and how they relate to your own life. 
2. The Biblical way of bringing our sorrows before the Lord is not just to pour out to Him about our situation and let out our emotions, but to also remember and declare who He is in the midst of it all. Write out your version of Psalm 22 - describing your situation as well as remembering who God is.


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
