### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Erza 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+7&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Ezra received assistance and favour from an unlikely source (King Artaxerxes). What does this reveal to you about God’s power and sovereignity? 
2. How does knowing that the Lord’s hand is upon you encourage you to go forth and fulfil God’s calling for you? 

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
