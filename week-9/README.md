# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We will wrap up on the theme of faith before returning to the book of Ezra. One key emphasis this week is “Faith without works is dead”. Many of us today might unknowingly approach our Christian faith with a Greek (Hellenistic) mindset – the end goal is knowledge and belief/philosophy. However, Scripture teaches us that our faith or a belief system must also translate into works. As you read through the passages this week, may the Holy Spirit search your heart and help you to translate your beliefs into good works.
