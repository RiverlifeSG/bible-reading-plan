### Week 9

## Monday

>  ““For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” – Ephesians 2:8-10 (ESV)

### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A15+-+2%3A10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ephesians 1:15 - 2:10</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. It is by grace through faith that we have been saved, raised and seated with Christ (2:5-6). What does it mean for you to be seated with Christ in the heavenly realms? (Refer also to (Romans 8:37)[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A37&version=ESV], (2 Corinthians 2:14)[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+2%3A14&version=ESV], (Colossians 3:1-4)[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A1-4&version=ESV])
2. We are “created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do”(2:10). How can you step out in faith to do good works?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
