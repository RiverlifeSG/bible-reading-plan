### Week 9

## Wednesday

>  “And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.” - Hebrews 11:39-40 (ESV)

### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A17-40&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 11:17-40</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Abraham demonstrated great faith in God when he willingly offered Isaac as a sacrifice (v 17-19). Are you willing to do the same if God asked you to sacrifice the one thing that you hold most dearly? What is holding you back?
2. Are there any areas in your life where you lived by faith but suffered for it (e.g. faced persecutions, opposition, or felt alienated etc.)? How does Hebrews 11 encourage you to keep on exercising your faith?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
