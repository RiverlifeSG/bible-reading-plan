### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A1-16&version=ESV" target="_blank">Hebrews 11:1-6</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. What does “assurance about what we do not see” (v 1) mean to you? (Read Faith: Assurance of Things Hoped For by Andrew Davis in Additional Resources)
2. The ancients lived their lives by faith and did not receive the things promised (v 13). How do the examples of the ancients strengthen your faith and inspire the way you live?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
