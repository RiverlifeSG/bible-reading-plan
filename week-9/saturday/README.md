### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Ezra 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+8&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
1. Although Ezra proclaimed faith in God’s protection, he still called on a fast to petition to God for a safe journey (v 21-23). Does this show a lack of faith? Why or why not?
2. “ Then I proclaimed a fast there…that we might humble ourselves before our God…”. (v 21) How does fasting help us to be humble before God?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
