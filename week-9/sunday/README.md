### Week 9

## Sunday

> “As soon as I heard this, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled. Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice.” - Ezra 9:3-4 (ESV)

### Today's Meditation
1. Read (Ezra 9)[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+9&version=ESV]


### Reflection Questions
1. Ezra described their sin as “faithlessness of the returned exiles”. (v 4) How is sin a demonstration of faithlessness? How does this affect our perception of God?
2. What is our responsibility towards our brothers/sisters when we notice sinful patterns in their lives? What does it mean to be “our brothers/sisters keeper”?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
