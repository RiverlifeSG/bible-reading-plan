# Week 9

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.jpg)

We will wrap up on the theme of _faith_ before returning to the book of Ezra. One key emphasis this week is “Faith without works is dead”. Many of us today might unknowingly approach our Christian faith with a Greek (Hellenistic) mindset – the end goal is knowledge and belief/philosophy. However, Scripture teaches us that our faith or a belief system must also translate into works. As you read through the passages this week, may the Holy Spirit search your heart and help you to translate your beliefs into good works.

## Monday

```
“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” – Ephesians 2:8-10 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ephesians 1:15 - 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A15+-+2%3A10&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. It is by grace through faith that we have been saved, raised and seated with Christ (2:5-6). What does it mean for you to be seated with Christ in the heavenly realms? (Refer also to [Romans 8:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A37&version=ESV), [2 Corinthians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+2%3A14&version=ESV), [Colossians 3:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A1-4&version=ESV))

2. We are “created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do”(2:10). How can you step out in faith to do good works?

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ezra 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+8&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Although Ezra proclaimed faith in God’s protection, he still called on a fast to petition to God for a safe journey (v 21-23). Does this show a lack of faith? Why or why not?

2. “Then I proclaimed a fast there…that we might humble ourselves before our God…”. (v 21) How does fasting help us to be humble before God?
