## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We begin our reading of 1 Peter in tandem with our new pulpit series. Each Sunday, we will read the Scriptures expounded during the sermon. Throughout the week, this is followed by examining other passages related to the topic preached on Sunday. In this week’s reading, we will examine the theme of discipleship – what it all means to be born into this living hope that we have.



## Monday

```
“Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves…” - Matthew 10:16 (ESV)
```

### Reflection Questions
1. Matthew 10 describes the commissioning of the 12 disciples. In this passage, Jesus warns them to expect persecution. Why should the disciples expect persecution?
2. “Christians in Singapore hardly experience any persecution as compared with those in some other countries.” Why is that so? How can we encourage and support fellow believers who face persecution in other countries?

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

2. Jesus spells out clearly to all who want to follow Him – it is going to be a tough journey involving much sacrifice. What are some dreams / goals / wants you have in your life which you are still struggling to lay at the foot of the cross?
