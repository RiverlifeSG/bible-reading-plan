# Week 22

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We look at what it means to be a chosen people and God’s special posession (1 Peter 2:9). Christ’s work on the cross, resulting in our salvation is not the end of our journey. In fact, it is only the beginning. Each day presents us an opportunity to conform into the likeness of Christ. This is what it means to be holy and set apart as God’s special posession. As we read the Bible passages this week, may we be reminded that the Christian life is not passive, but it is a lifetime of walking with God daily and becoming more like Christ!



## Monday

```
“But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.” – 1 John 1:7 (NIV)
