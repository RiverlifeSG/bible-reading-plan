### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+8&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 8</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. The book of Nehemiah shows us that one of the first step towards a revitalised life is to revive one’s love for God’s Word. Evaluate your hunger for God’s Word. Are you eagerly feeding on His Word everyday? How can it be better?
2. “Be quiet, for this day is holy...” (v 11) Examine your heart’s attitude towards the Lord’s Day / Sabbath. What about it needs to change so that the sacredness of this day (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A8-11&version=ESV" target="_blank">Exodus 20:8-11</a>) is maintained in your life?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
