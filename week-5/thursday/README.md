### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A3-11&version=ESV" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 1:3-11</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. God comforts us in our affliction (v 4). Contrast how God journeys with you in your suffering, with that of your earthly father. Take some time to reflect - Are there any mindset or deep-rooted assumption you may have about God and how He wants to journey with you in your affliction, that needs to change?
2. Paul shares with us his perspective on suffering in v 6 – it is for the benefit of others. Who is someone that may benefit from watching you go through your affliction in hope and with tenacity?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
