### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+7&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 7</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. In verses 1-2, Nehemiah established governance and roles within the city so that God is continually worshipped and His ways are followed. What are some practices/mindsets/changes that God has called you to establish during this season of “rebuilding” so that His ways are preserved in your life and that He is continually Lord of all? 
2. History estimates that only about 2% of the Babylonian exiles returned to Jerusalem. Many were not willing to give up their current life and establish a new one. What are some possible obstacles that may prevent you from forsaking your old ways and embracing God’s ways after a season of trial or suffering?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
