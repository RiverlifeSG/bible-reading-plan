### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A39-46&version=ESV" target="_blank">Luke 22:39-46</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. In v44, we see Jesus in agony. Contrast this verse with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms++147%3A2-9&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalms 147:2-9</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A28&version=ESV" target="_blank">Isaiah 40:28</a>. What comes to your mind as you meditate on these verses?
2. Describe how different life would look like if your daily posture has been “not my will but Yours be done.”


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
