# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We continue our theme on trials and afflictions before our final lap in Nehemiah. C. S. Lewis once said, “Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.” The hardship that we go through is preparing us to walk in the paths that God has prepared for us, just like Nehemiah. Therefore, how we approach our affliction matters. May your hearts be strengthened this week as we continue on this theme.
