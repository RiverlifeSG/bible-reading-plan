### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+9&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 9</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. One of the keys to revival is repentance and it begins with confession. Examine the prayer of the Israelites in this chapter. List down the key themes covered in their prayer of confession. How can the practice of confession be part of your life?
2. Referring to the themes you picked out in the first question, write out your own version of a prayer of confession to God for your life.


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
