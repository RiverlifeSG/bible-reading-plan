### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27%3A32-50&version=ESV" target="_blank">Matthew 27:32-50</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. In this account of the crucifixion, Jesus was mocked, insulted, tortured and hung on a cross. If you were in Jesus’s position, what would you be feeling at this point of suffering?
2. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53%3A7&version=ESV" target="_blank">Isaiah 53:7</a>. Although Jesus received all these suffering, what did He not do? What does that teach us about approaching the most difficult of trials?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
