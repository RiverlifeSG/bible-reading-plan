### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A16-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 8:16-25</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. “The sufferings of the present are not worth comparing with the future glory to be revealed to us…” What do you think the Apostle Paul means by this? Refer to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+11%3A6-9&version=ESV" target="_blank">Isaiah 11:6-9</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A1-7&version=ESV" target="_blank">Revelation 21:1-7</a> to have a glimpse the “future glory”. 
2. Verses 20-21 give us a glimpse as to why God allows suffering at times. Recall the major trials or suffering in your life. What were some possible reasons God allowed you to go through them?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
