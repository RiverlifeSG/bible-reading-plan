# Week 5

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.jpg)

We continue our theme on trials and afflictions before our final lap in Nehemiah. C. S. Lewis once said, “Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.” The hardship that we go through is preparing us to walk in the paths that God has prepared for us, just like Nehemiah. Therefore, how we approach our affliction matters. May your hearts be strengthened this week as we continue on this theme.

## Monday

```
“Nevertheless, not my will, but Yours, be done.” - Luke 22:42 (ESV)

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Luke 22:39-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A39-46&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. In v44, we see Jesus in agony. Contrast this verse with [Psalms 147:2-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms++147%3A2-9&version=ESV) and [Isaiah 40:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A28&version=ESV). What comes to your mind as you meditate on these verses?

2. In the space below, describe how different life would look like if your daily posture has been “not my will but Yours be done.”

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Tuesday

```
“And those who passed by derided Him, wagging their heads…” - Matthew 27:39 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Matthew 27:32-50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27%3A32-50&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. In this account of the crucifixion, Jesus was mocked, insulted, tortured and hung on a cross. If you were in Jesus’s position, what would you be feeling at this point of suffering?

2. Read [Isaiah 53:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53%3A7&version=ESV) Although Jesus received all these suffering, what did He <u>not</u> do? What does that teach us about approaching the most difficult of trials?

## Wednesday

“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” - Romans 8:18 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Romans 8:16-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A16-25&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. “The sufferings of the present are not worth comparing with the future glory to be revealed to us…” What do you think the Apostle Paul means by this? Refer to _[Isaiah 11:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+11%3A6-9&version=ESV)_ and _[Revelation 21:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A1-7&version=ESV)_ to have a glimpse the “future glory”.

2. Verses 20-21 give us a glimpse as to why God allows suffering at times. Recall the major trials or suffering in your life. What were some possible reasons God allowed you to go through them?

## Thursday

```
“If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation…” - 2 Corinthians 2:6 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [2 Corinthians 1:3-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A3-11&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. God comforts us in our affliction (v 4). Contrast how God journeys with you in your suffering, with that of your earthly father. Take some time to reflect - Are there any mindset or deep-rooted assumption you may have about God and how He wants to journey with you in your affliction, that needs to change?

2. Paul shares with us his perspective on suffering in v 6 – it is for the benefit of others. Who is someone that may benefit from watching you go through your affliction in hope and with tenacity?

## FRIDAY

```
“The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few, and no houses had been rebuilt.” - Nehemiah 7:4 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+7&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. In verses 1-2, Nehemiah established governance and roles within the city so that God is continually worshipped and His ways are followed. What are some practices/mindsets/changes that God has called you to establish during this season of “rebuilding” so that His ways are preserved in your life and that He is continually Lord of all?

2. History estimates that only about 2% of the Babylonian exiles returned to Jerusalem. Many were not willing to give up their current life and establish a new one. What are some possible obstacles that may prevent you from forsaking your old ways and embracing God’s ways after a season of trial or suffering?

## Saturday

```
“…and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands.” - Nehemiah 8:6 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+8&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. The book of Nehemiah shows us that one of the first step towards a revitalised life is to revive one’s love for God’s Word. Evaluate your hunger for God’s Word. Are you eagerly feeding on His Word everyday? How can it be better?

2. “Be quiet, for this day is holy...” (v 11) Examine your heart’s attitude towards the Lord’s Day / Sabbath. What about it needs to change so that the sacredness of this day ([Exodus 20:8-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A8-11&version=ESV)) is maintained in your life?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

## Sunday

```
“And the Israelites separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.” - Nehemiah 9:2 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+9&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. One of the keys to revival is repentance and it begins with confession. Examine the prayer of the Israelites in this chapter. List down the key themes covered in their prayer of confession. How can the practice of confession be part of your life?

2. Referring to the themes you picked out in the first question, write out your own version of a prayer of confession to God for your life.
