### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+13&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 13</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. What role did the Word of God play in Nehemiah’s leadership of the people? Why do you think this was so?
2. What is the role of the Word of God in your life? What were some occasions when the Word of God changed the trajectory of your decision(s) even though it differed from your preference.

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
