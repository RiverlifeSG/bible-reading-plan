# Week 6

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.jpg)

This week, we conclude our time in the book of Nehemiah and begin on Ezra, another book related to this time period. One theme will surface from our readings this week – the value of the house of God to you. As you read through these passages, may the Lord awaken your love and passion for your spiritual home in RiverLife Church. It is way more than just another place of worship. It is YOUR church and YOUR family. Let’s emerge from this week with a renewed devotion for this church we call OUR church.

## Monday

```
“We will not neglect the house of our God.” - Nehemiah 10:39 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+10&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Verses 32-39 describe the pledge the Jewish people made; they wanted to give their best to the house of God. Evaluate your life in the last couple of years. Have you given your best to the house of God (not just financially)?

2. How can you give your best to the house of God from this day onwards? Write down a pledge similar to these verses - “I commit myself to……(pledge)……for the House of the Lord from this day onwards.”

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Tuesday

```
“And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem.” - Nehemiah 11:2 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+11&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Why was it critical for one tenth of the Jewish people to populate Jerusalem? What do these people have to sacrifice in order to live in Jerusalem?

2. Similarly, many in our church have made sacrifices to serve others in this spiritual family. Think of at least 3 people in your cell or community circle that have done so, and how can you bless these individuals during this season? (v 2)

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

## Wednesday

```
“And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced…” - Nehemiah 12:43 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Nehemiah 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+12&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Put yourselves in the shoes of the Jewish people. Why do you think you would rejoice greatly on that day (v 43)?

2. When was the last time you rejoiced greatly because you made “an investment” into the house of God? In this season, what is one aspect of the House of God that you would like to invest your life into so that you can rejoice greatly when it produces fruit?

### Reflection Questions

1. What role did the Word of God play in Nehemiah’s leadership of the people? Why do you think this was so?

2. What is the role of the Word of God in your life? What were some occasions when the Word of God changed the trajectory of your decision(s) even though it differed from your preference.

### Today’s Meditation

1. [Ezra 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+1&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. A revival was about to come to Jerusalem. According to this passage, who was the initiator of this revival? (v 1, 5) Therefore, what should our posture be if we want to see revival in our lives?

2. God knew precisely what Jerusalem needed for revival (v 7-11). Take a moment to ponder on areas of your life in need of a revival that God is showing you.

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ezra 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+2&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Why was it so important for the Jewish people to record the details of these individuals?

2. The culture of honour is always one of the fruits of a revived life. Think about those who have authority over your lives – parents, supervisors, bosses, leaders, pastors, the government, etc. Do you honour them? How would you (continue to) honour them?

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Ezra 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+3&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. What are some possible reasons these old men (who had seen the previous temple) wept when they saw the foundation of the temple being laid, while the others rejoiced?

2. What does RiverLife Church mean to you? Is it just another church or is it YOUR church? What does it practically mean for RiverLife to be YOUR church?
