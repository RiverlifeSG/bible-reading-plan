# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

This week, we conclude our time in the book of Nehemiah and begin on Ezra, another book related to this time period. One theme will surface from our readings this week – the value of the house of God to you. As you read through these passages, may the Lord awaken your love and passion for your spiritual home in RiverLife Church. It is way more than just another place of worship. It is YOUR church and YOUR family. Let’s emerge from this week with a renewed devotion for this church we call OUR church.
