### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ezra 3</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. What are some possible reasons these old men (who had seen the previous temple) wept when they saw the foundation of the temple being laid, while the others rejoiced?
2. What does RiverLife Church mean to you? Is it just another church or is it YOUR church? What does it practically mean for RiverLife to be YOUR church?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
