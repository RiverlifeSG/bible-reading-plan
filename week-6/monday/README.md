### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 10</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Verses 32-39 describe the pledge the Jewish people made; they wanted to give their best to the house of God. Evaluate your life in the last couple of years. Have you given your best to the house of God (not just financially)?
2. How can you give your best to the house of God from this day onwards? Write down a pledge similar to these verses - “I commit myself to……. (pledge)…. for the House of the Lord from this day onwards.”


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
