### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+11&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 11</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Why was it critical for one tenth of the Jewish people to populate Jerusalem? What do these people have to sacrifice in order to live in Jerusalem?
2. Similarly, many in our church have made sacrifices to serve others in this spiritual family. Think of at least 3 people in your cell or community circle that have done so, and how can you bless these individuals during this season? (v 2)


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
