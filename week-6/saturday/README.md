### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+2&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ezra 2</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Why was it so important for the Jewish people to record the details of these individuals?
2. The culture of honour is always one of the fruits of a revived life. Think about those who have authority over your lives – parents, supervisors, bosses, leaders, pastors, the government, etc. Do you honour them? How would you (continue to) honour them?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
