### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+12&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 12</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Put yourselves in the shoes of the Jewish people. Why do you think you would rejoice greatly on that day (v 43)? 
2. When was the last time you rejoiced greatly because you made “an investment” into the house of God? In this season, what is one aspect of the House of God that you would like to invest your life into so that you can rejoice greatly when it produces fruit?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
