### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+1&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ezra 1</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. A revival was about to come to Jerusalem. According to this passage, who was the initiator of this revival? (v 1, 5) Therefore, what should our posture be if we want to see revival in our lives?
2. God knew precisely what Jerusalem needed for revival (v 7-11). Take a moment to ponder on areas of your life in need of a revival that God is showing you.


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
