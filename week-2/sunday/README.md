Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+4&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 4</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. Opposition is to be expected when we want to “fortify the walls of our lives.” What kind of opposition do you think you will face or are currently facing? (eg. temptations, lifestyle, sinful acts, discouragements, etc.)
2. “Hear, O our God, for we are despised.” How can you deal with your oppositions in a God-honouring way?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
