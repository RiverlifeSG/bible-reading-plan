### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+3&version=ESV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 3</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. Nehemiah 3 has a long list of people that contributed to the rebuilding of the walls. What does it tell you about the role your spiritual community plays in your life?
2. Name 2 - 3 people that you would ask to intentionally help you “fortify your walls”. Practically, what can they do to help you?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
