### Reflection Questions

1. True forgiveness of sins require genuine acknowledgment of one’s sins. Take some time to examine your life and to know your true state before God.
2. What does the forgiveness of sins mean to you? Contrast your posture towards God’s forgiveness with that of the sinful woman.


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
