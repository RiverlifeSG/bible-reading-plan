### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A3-29&version=ESV" target="_blank">1 John 2:3-29</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. “Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.” Are there fellow believers in your life that you find difficult to love? How then can you “be in the light” in these relationships?
2. Examine your life in the light of this passage. Are there any areas in your life that exhibit a love for the world (vs. 15-16)?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
