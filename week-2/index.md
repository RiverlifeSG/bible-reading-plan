This week, we continue to expore the theme of sin and brokenness, but in the light of what Christ has done for us. We will then pick up from where we left off in Nehemiah - the surveying of the wall and the rebuilding in the midst of opposition.

## Monday

```
“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” - Mark 4:9 (ESV)
