### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+4&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ezra 4</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. God had granted the Jewish exiles favour in the eyes of King Cyrus and they succeeded in returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. But they faced opposition from enemies. How do you respond when opposition comes your way in your “successful” journey of faith or ministry?
2. Meditate on Luke 6:27. How can you practically “love” and “do good” to those who mistreat you?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
