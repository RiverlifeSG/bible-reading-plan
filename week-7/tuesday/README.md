### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+5&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ezra 5</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. God used Zerubbabel and Jeshua to lead the temple rebuilding project and the people followed them. How do you view your leaders in church (CLs, AOs, ministry leaders, elders and pastors)? Is it one of honour, of criticism or of indifference? Allow the Holy Spirit to expose what is within your heart.
2. In this season, there is a call from the church leadership to rebuild our cell groups (refer to our Senior Pastor’s address [here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/riverlife-church/riverlife-weekly-3-rebuilding/3284158181604779)). How can you intentionally “rebuild” your cell group? List some practical steps you want to commit to doing. 


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
