### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15%3A1-6&version=ESV" target="_blank">Genesis 15:1-6</a>
2. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A13-25&version=ESV" target="_blank">Romans 4:13-25</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Abram demonstrated a seemingly lack of faith in the goodness of God in v2. Does God allow us to come to Him with our questions and doubts? Or must we always come to Him in faith (refer to [Mark 9:23-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9%3A23-25&version=ESV))?
2. Romans 4:13-25 tell us why Abraham is counted as righteous. According to v 24, how are we to be counted as righteous?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
