# Week 7

## This Week’s Focus

![](./media/image5.jpg)

This week, we continue our reading on the book of Ezra. After Chapter 6, we will pause and examine the theme of faith. Faith is so foundational in our relationship with God. Scripture teaches us that “without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NIV) As we stay on this theme, may God shape your heart to be like Abraham’s – a man of great faith. Have a blessed time meditating on Scriptures!

## Monday

```
“You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.” – Ezra 4:3 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

- [Ezra 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+4&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. God had granted the Jewish exiles favour in the eyes of King Cyrus and they succeeded in returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. But they faced opposition from enemies. How do you respond when opposition comes your way in your “successful” journey of faith or ministry?

2. Meditate on Luke 6:27. How can you practically “love” and “do good” to those who mistreat you?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening

1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Tuesday

```
“We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.” – Ezra 5:11 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. [Ezra 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+5&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. God used Zerubbabel and Jeshua to lead the temple rebuilding project and the people followed them. How do you view your leaders in church (CLs, AOs, ministry leaders, elders and pastors)? Is it one of honour, of criticism or of indifference? Allow the Holy Spirit to expose what is within your heart.

2. In this season, there is a call from the church leadership to rebuild our cell groups (refer to our Senior Pastor’s address [here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/riverlife-church/riverlife-weekly-3-rebuilding/3284158181604779). How can you intentionally “rebuild” your cell group? List some practical steps you want to commit to doing.

## Wednesday

```
“And the people of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.” - Ezra 6:16 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. [Ezra 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+6&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. King Darius expected all his subjects to obey his decree. If not, they were to be executed. Is there any difference in your obedience towards the laws of this country versus God’s commandments? Why is that so?

2. The completion of the temple was celebrated with great joy. When was the last time you celebrated God’s goodness to you and/or the church? Has it been more meditative rather than celebrative? How can you rediscover the joy of celebrating God’s goodness?

## Thursday

```
“And he believed the Lord, and He counted it to him as righteousness.” - Genesis 15:6 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. [Genesis 15:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15%3A1-6&version=ESV)
2. [Romans 4:13-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4%3A13-25&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Abram demonstrated a seemingly lack of faith in the goodness of God in v2. Does God allow us to come to Him with our questions and doubts? Or must we always come to Him in faith (refer to [Mark 9:23-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+9%3A23-25&version=ESV))?

2. Romans 4:13-25 tell us why Abraham is counted as righteous. According to v 24, how are we to be counted as righteous?

## FRIDAY

```
“So Abraham called the name of that place, ‘The Lord will provide’; as it is said to this day, ‘On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.’” - Genesis 22:14 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. [Genesis 22:1-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+22%3A1-14&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. What was God’s purpose in testing Abraham? Doesn’t God already know all things, including what Abraham would do? (Refer to [Psalm 66:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+66%3A10&version=ESV), [James 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A3&version=ESV), [Jeremiah 17:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17%3A10&version=ESV))

2. Would you give God your life if He gave back nothing but Himself? How much do the “benefits/blessings of God” motivate you in your walk with God?

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Saturday

```
“If the Lord delights in us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.” - Numbers 14:8 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Numbers 13:25–14:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+13%3A25%E2%80%9314%3A10&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. Considering that the Israelites witnessed unbelievable things (e.g. the Red Sea parting), why do you think they doubted God’s ability to deliver on His promise? Why is doubting often easier than having faith?

2. In Numbers 14:4, the people planned to head back to slavery in Egypt. In what ways do we frequently do the same – heading back to something that has enslaved us rather than stepping out in faith towards God’s plan for our freedom in Him?

2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

## Sunday

```
“Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.” - Joshua 3:5 (ESV)
```

<img src="./media/image6.jpg" style="width: 150px">

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [Joshua 3:5-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+3%3A5-17&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. How is the crossing of the River Jordan different from the crossing of the Red Sea? Refer to [Exodus 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+14&version=ESV) and look for the differences in the way the crossing was done.

2. The parting of the Red Sea crossing was instantaneous. The River Jordan crossing depended on the water source to stop flowing. It took more time (possibly a few hours). Sometimes, God’s promise doesn’t come instantaneously. How can we have faith in times when our reality does not match God’s promises for us?
