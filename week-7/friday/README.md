### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+22%3A1-14&version=ESV" target="_blank">Genesis 22:1-14</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. What was God’s purpose in testing Abraham? Doesn’t God already know all things, including what Abraham would do? (Refer to [Psalm 66:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+66%3A10&version=ESV), [James 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A3&version=ESV), [Jeremiah 17:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17%3A10&version=ESV))
2. Would you give God your life if He gave back nothing but Himself? How much do the “benefits/blessings of God” motivate you in your walk with God?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
