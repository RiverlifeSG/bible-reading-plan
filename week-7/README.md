# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

This week, we continue our reading on the book of Ezra. After Chapter 6, we will pause and examine the theme of faith. Faith is so foundational in our relationship with God. Scripture teaches us that “without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NIV) As we stay on this theme, may God shape your heart to be like Abraham’s – a man of great faith. Have a blessed time meditating on Scriptures!
