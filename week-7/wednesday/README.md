### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+6&version=ESV" target="_blank">Ezra 6</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. King Darius expected all his subjects to obey his decree. If not, they were to be executed. Is there any difference in your obedience towards the laws of this country versus God’s commandments? Why is that so?
2. The completion of the temple was celebrated with great joy. When was the last time you celebrated God’s goodness to you and/or the church? Has it been more meditative rather than celebrative? How can you rediscover the joy of celebrating God’s goodness?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
