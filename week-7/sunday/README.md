### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+3%3A5-17&version=ESV" target="_blank">Joshua 3:5-17</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. How is the crossing of the River Jordan different from the crossing of the Red Sea? Refer to [Exodus 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+14&version=ESV) and look for the differences in the way the crossing was done.
2. The parting of the Red Sea crossing was instantaneous. The River Jordan crossing depended on the water source to stop flowing. It took more time (possibly a few hours). Sometimes, God’s promise doesn’t come instantaneously. How can we have faith in times when our reality does not match God’s promises for us?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
