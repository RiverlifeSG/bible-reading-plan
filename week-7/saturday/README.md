### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+13%3A25%E2%80%9314%3A10&version=ESV" target="_blank">Numbers 13:25-14:10</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Considering that the Israelites witnessed unbelievable things (e.g. the Red Sea parting), why do you think they doubted God’s ability to deliver on His promise? Why is doubting often easier than having faith? 
2. In Numbers 14:4, the people planned to head back to slavery in Egypt. In what ways do we frequently do the same – heading back to something that has enslaved us rather than stepping out in faith towards God’s plan for our freedom in Him?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
