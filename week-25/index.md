# Week 25

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We start with the topic of submission in the midst of unfairness. One of the struggles believers will commonly face in such situations is doubt. As a result, we struggle to trust God and His ways. This week, we will examine this topic of doubt through the various readings. May you be encouraged by our trustworthy God in His Word. 



## Monday

```
“Their voices rose in a great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron. ‘If only we had died in Egypt, or even here in the wilderness!’ they complained.” - Numbers 14:2 (NLT)
