# Week 18

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We will finish our study of King Hezekiah’s reign before reading the Psalms of Ascent (Psalm 120-134). These psalms were sung by the Jewish worshippers as they headed up to Jerusalem for the 3 pilgrim festivals (Deuteronomy 16:16). Imagine being in exile and unable to go to Jerusalem as the temple was destroyed. That was what Israel experienced during their years of exile. Doesn’t that mirror our COVID-19 situation today? As you read these Psalms, may God grant you a greater appreciation for the gathering of the body of Christ each Sunday!



## Monday

```
“Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says…” – 2 Kings 18:31 (NIV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 18:13-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+18%3A13-37&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. What was the Rabshakeh’s promise to the Judeans who chooses not to listen to Hezekiah? (vv 31-32)
2. Similarly today, what are the world’s promises to us if we choose not to trust God’s ways? Why are we so prone to listen and seek after the world’s promises instead of God’s? (see also [Jeremiah 17:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jeremiah+17%3A9&version=NIV), [Romans 8:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A7&version=NIV), [Proverbs 4:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+4%3A23&version=NIV), [James 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A14&version=NIV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Tuesday

```
“When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.” – 2 Kings 19:1 (NIV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+19&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Why do you think King Hezekiah tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth when he heard the words of the Rabshakeh? (v 1)
2. What does this phrase, “The zeal of the Lord will do this” in verse 31 mean? (see also [John 2:13-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+2%3A13-17&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Wednesday

```
“They have seen all that is in my house…” – 2 Kings 20:15 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+20&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Why did Hezekiah show the envoys of Merodach-baladan all that was in his house and his storehouses? (v 12-13)
2. If Hezekiah’s purpose was to seek peace with Babylon, why was he judged so harshly by God in verses 16-19? (see also [Joshua 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+9&version=ESV) and note v14)

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Thursday

```
“I will lift up my eyes to the hills...” – Psalm 121:1 (NKJV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 121](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+121&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Many Bible scholars believe that verses 1-2 were spoken by the “pilgrim”/”traveller”, while the rest of the psalm is the response of the worship leader/priest. List the phrases used by the Psalmist to indicate that he was talking about an actual journey.
2. The Jew’s journey to Jerusalem for pilgrimage consists of many possible dangers – hidden bandits, scorching sun, dangerous terrains, etc. They would recite this Psalm and remember who God as they journey to Jerusalem. Which 3 words/phrases (vv 2, 5) are used to describe God. Recount a current/recent situation that was met by any of these descriptions of God.

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Friday

```
“Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem…” – Psalm 122:2 (HCSB)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 122](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+122&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. This psalm is a play on the word, Jerusalem - City of Peace (“yeru” meaning city, and “salem” meaning peace). Today however, peace is a rarity in Jerusalem. According to the words of Christ in [Luke 19:41-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+19%3A41-44&version=ESV), what is the ultimate reason peace eludes Jerusalem?
2. When Israel was in exile and the temple was destroyed, the Jews could not go to Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts of God. Thus, Psalm 122 became a lamentation. During this COVID-19 season when we are unable to gather physically as a church, what do you miss about “going to church”? 

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Saturday

```
“If the Lord had not been on our side…” – Psalm 124:1 (HCSB)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 124](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms+124&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. This psalm describes the vicious attacvks of men. Our toughest challenges most often involve people rather than circumstances. Have you ever felt like someone was against and/or despised you? If so, describe your feelings when you first discovered it.
2. A better translation from Hebrew of verse 2 is “It was Yahweh. But, if it had not been…” Recall an incident where God “rescued” you from reacting spitefully, vengefully or angrily towards a difficult individual who has hurt you deeply. What might have happened “if the Lord had not been on your side”? Take some time to thank the Lord.

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Sunday

```
“…so that the righteous will not apply their hands to injustice.” – Psalm 125:3 (HCSB)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 125](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms+125&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. “For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous…” (v 3). How does this happen? (see verse 2)
2. How does the Lord surround a believer today? (see [Psalm 103:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A13&version=ESV), [116:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+116%3A8-9&version=ESV), [Proverbs 3:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A11-12&version=ESV), [John 14:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A16&version=ESV), [Romans 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8&version=ESV)). Recall an incident in your life when the Lord surrounded you and protected you from “the scepter of wickedness”.
