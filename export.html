<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We continue our examination of the proclamation of God’s judgement on the nations of Israel through the prophets Isaiah and Hosea. Despite their numerous warnings, Israel remained stubborn and unrepentant; leading to their ultimate exile. As you read through the Scriptures this week, may the Holy Spirit remind you of the importance of having an open and tender heart before Him.</p>

</ol>

<h3 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Verses 1-9 show Israel’s failure to see the connection between an action and its consequences, and Israel’s refusal to recognise the boundaries set by God. Personal freedom is a right held firmly by many people today. As a believer, how firmly should we hold onto our personal freedom? (see also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A23-24&amp;version=ESV">1 Corinthians 10:23-24</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A31-33&amp;version=ESV">31-33</a>)</li>
  <li>Verses 10-29 deal with the human tendency to use religious behaviour as a means of manipulating God for our own benefit. How then should we come before God in prayer for our needs? (see also <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A6&amp;version=ESV">Philippians 4:6</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A5-8&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 6:5-8</a>)</li>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We come to the end of exploring how the nation of Israel landed up in exile. God’s Word through the prophet Micah was a warning to the idolatrous nation to turn from her ways. But sadly, Israel continued in her sin. As you read through the passages this week, may your spiritual ears be open to listen to God’s still small voice – calling you back to Him, especially those areas in your life that you have yet to surrender to Him.</p>

<p>We continue our exploration of the Psalms of Ascent before embarking on a study of 1 Peter, in line with our pulpit series. As you read through the Psalms this week, may you observe the various postures that we should have as we approach God in worship. Our worship of God must be an outflow of a life that fears Him and walks in His ways.</p>

  <li>A believer’s journey with the Lord is not without suffering and difficult circumstances, even though he/she fears the Lord and walks in His ways. How then should we define “blessed”?

<p>We begin our reading of 1 Peter in tandem with our new pulpit series. Each Sunday, we will read the Scriptures expounded during the sermon. Throughout the week, this is followed by examining other passages related to the topic preached on Sunday. In this week’s reading, we will examine the theme of discipleship – what it all means to be born into this living hope that we have.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We will finish our study of King Hezekiah’s reign before reading the Psalms of Ascent (Psalm 120-134). These psalms were sung by the Jewish worshippers as they headed up to Jerusalem for the 3 pilgrim festivals (Deuteronomy 16:16). Imagine being in exile and unable to go to Jerusalem as the temple was destroyed. That was what Israel experienced during their years of exile. Doesn’t that mirror our COVID-19 situation today? As you read these Psalms, may God grant you a greater appreciation for the gathering of the body of Christ each Sunday!</p>

  <li>Many Bible scholars believe that verses 1-2 were spoken by the “pilgrim”/”traveller”, while the rest of the psalm is the response of the worship leader/priest. List the phrases used by the Psalmist to indicate that he was talking about an actual journey.</li>
  <li>The Jew’s journey to Jerusalem for pilgrimage consists of many possible dangers – hidden bandits, scorching sun, dangerous terrains, etc. They would recite this Psalm and remember who God as they journey to Jerusalem.

  <li>This psalm is a play on the word, Jerusalem - City of Peace (“yeru” meaning city, and “salem” meaning peace). Today however, peace is a rarity in Jerusalem. According to the words of Christ in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+19%3A41-44&amp;version=ESV">Luke 19:41-44</a>, what is the ultimate reason peace eludes Jerusalem?</li>
  <li>When Israel was in exile and the temple was destroyed, the Jews could not go to Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts of God. Thus, Psalm 122 became a lamentation. During this COVID-19 season when we are unable to gather physically as a church, what do you miss about “going to church”?</li>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>In line with 1 Peter sermon series, we will deal with the topic of holiness – what does it mean to live holy lives. We are to be holy, because God is holy and we are His ambassadors here on this earth. We reveal God’s holiness to the world in our everyday lives through our speech, our deeds, the way we live and how we relate to others. As you read through these passages, may you realise the impact you make when you live a holy life each day as sojourners in this world.</p>

<p>This week, we approach the final parts of Solomon’s reflections in Proverbs. Then we continue our exploration into the history of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel. We uncover one common theme when we examine the various kings – if they walk in God’s ways, all will be well for them. If they forsake the Lord, they end up in a place of destruction and judgment. May we learn from their examples and walk in God’s ways at all times!</p>

<p>We look at the ministry of Elisha, the successor of the great Elijah. From the readings, we will see miracle after miracle being performed by Elisha. This is testament to the fact that the God of the Bible is a miracle-working God. Our God is a God of miracles to Israel and Judah… and He still is today to us, and forever He will be. As you read through the passages, may your hearts be lifted up to the God of miracles.</p>

Imagine what the church would look like if every family was not just surviving, but thriving!

<p>We continue to trace the history of Israel and Judah during the times of the divided kingdom. One theme emerges from this week’s reading – God’s promises. It always comes to pass. Every prophecy spoken over the various kings of Israel and Judah came to pass. Every promise of God spoken over His people came to pass. Why? That’s who God is - He is a faithful God and our God does not lie. May your hearts be encouraged this week by the God who keeps all of His promises!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>This week, we will explore the final chapters of Solomon’s end-of-life reflections in the book of Ecclesiastes. His conclusion for mankind is this – Fear God and keep His commandments… (Ecc. 12:13-14). The fear of the Lord is one topic that is hardly talked about in churches today. Many prefer to focus on the love and grace of God. Solomon, however reminds us of a coming reality that we will all stand before God who will judge us at the end of days. May the Lord ignite in you a desire to live for that which is eternal and not temporal!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We will examine the topic of submission to authority. Submission is not a popular word today as it implies weakness. However, this is contrary to what Scripture teaches. In the Bible, submission is a sign of strength - best examplified in the life of Christ who though being equal with God Himself, submitted fully to the will of the Father. May you be reminded to posture your heart to emulate the submission of Christ as you read and ponder on this week’s readings.</p>

<h2 id="this-weeks-focus">This Week’s Focus</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>We look at what it means to be a chosen people and God’s special posession (1 Peter 2:9). Christ’s work on the cross, resulting in our salvation is not the end of our journey. In fact, it is only the beginning. Each day presents us an opportunity to conform into the likeness of Christ. This is what it means to be holy and set apart as God’s special posession. As we read the Bible passages this week, may we be reminded that the Christian life is not passive, but it is a lifetime of walking with God daily and becoming more like Christ!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>This week, we keep at the narratives of the book of Kings and see how king after king did evil in the sight of the Lord. They continued to be unfaithful to the covenant and lead the people to transgress the law by instituting idolatry. Many prophets were sent by God to warn the kings (including Elijah), but they remained unrepentant. As such, judgment came upon them. As we read through the pages of Scripture, may we take to heart that God desires His people to stay faithful to Him.</p>

<p><img src="/bible-reading-plan/week-10/media/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We will close on the book of Ezra and embark on the post-Davidic history of Israel, beginning with Solomon. Understanding this history will provide us with a greater appreciation of the events in the books of Nehemiah and Ezra. Our first pit stop is the book of Ecclesiastes. The phrase, “Vanity, vanity…” will echo throughout the book as Solomon challenges us on how everything in this life and in this world is meaningless apart from a relationship with God. As you read through Solomon’s words, may it rouse you to live a God-centred life and may you always remember that this world is not your home!</p>

<p><u>NOTE</u>: We recommend you watch “Overview – Ecclesiastes” in the Additional Resources before you start reading the book of Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>We ended last week by seeing how Nehemiah and Judah prevailed against those who oppose their work of rebuilding the walls. Opposition is to be expected every time we walk in obedience to God’s ways and commands. At times, the journey can be tough and we all need encouragement from fellow brothers and sisters as we enter by the narrow gate. This week, we will explore the theme of encouragement.</p>

<p>We will look to God’s Word concerning encouragement and how His Word can encourage us when the going gets tough.</p>

<h2 id="this-weeks-focus-4">This Week’s Focus</h2>

<p><img src="/bible-reading-plan/week-4/media/image5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We begin another theme - suffering - as we see how opposition continues to rise against Nehemiah. But more importantly, we see Nehemiah’s response to these oppositions. Oppositions and suffering for doing right is a subject that affects many of us, albeit some more than others.</p>

<p>Jesus himself warned us that we will have “tribulation” (John 16:33) in this world. Having a right perspective and response towards suffering is crucial for a believer. As you go through the various passages this week, may the Word of God shape your worldview on this theme so that your response towards suffering will be one that brings glory to His name!</p>

<p>We continue our theme on trials and afflictions before our final lap in Nehemiah. C. S. Lewis once said, “Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.” The hardship that we go through is preparing us to walk in the paths that God has prepared for us, just like Nehemiah. Therefore, how we approach our affliction matters. May your hearts be strengthened this week as we continue on this theme.</p>

<p>This week, we conclude our time in the book of Nehemiah and begin on Ezra, another book related to this time period. One theme will surface from our readings this week – the value of the house of God to you. As you read through these passages, may the Lord awaken your love and passion for your spiritual home in RiverLife Church. It is way more than just another place of worship. It is YOUR church and YOUR family. Let’s emerge from this week with a renewed devotion for this church we call OUR church.</p>

<p><img src="/bible-reading-plan/week-7/media/image5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This week, we continue our reading on the book of Ezra. After Chapter 6, we will pause and examine the theme of faith. Faith is so foundational in our relationship with God. Scripture teaches us that “without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NIV) As we stay on this theme, may God shape your heart to be like Abraham’s – a man of great faith. Have a blessed time meditating on Scriptures!</p>

<p>This week, we continue our readings on the theme of faith. In the New Testament, <em>faith</em> (<em>Greek</em>: pistis) is always taught as a gift from God, and never something that can be produced by people. As you meditate on the various accounts of the heroes of faith in the Bible, may the Lord grant you a greater revelation of who He is, so that your faith can increase! Have a blessed time in God’s Word.</p>

<p>We will wrap up on the theme of <em>faith</em> before returning to the book of Ezra. One key emphasis this week is “Faith without works is dead”. Many of us today might unknowingly approach our Christian faith with a Greek (Hellenistic) mindset – the end goal is knowledge and belief/philosophy. However, Scripture teaches us that our faith or a belief system must also translate into works. As you read through the passages this week, may the Holy Spirit search your heart and help you to translate your beliefs into good works.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px" /></p>

<p>The mark of a growing disciple is the discipline to self-feed. During this unprecedented time, the Lord is redirecting His people to pause and rediscover Him and His ways afresh. This is the heart behind our Bible Reading Plan - that we, as a church will delight the Father when we are growing in our love for Him and allowing His Spirit to move us in obeying His Word in our lives.</p>

<p>The Bible Reading Plan comprises a daily passage with reflection questions to guide you in meditation. You can also journal what God’s Spirit is prompting you to do in applying the Word. We pray that as you carve out unhurried time to encounter God, you will revitalise your spiritual life and encourage others to experience likewise!</p>
