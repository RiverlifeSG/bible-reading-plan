# Week 14

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We look at the ministry of Elisha, the successor of the great Elijah. From the readings, we will see miracle after miracle being performed by Elisha. This is testament to the fact that the God of the Bible is a miracle-working God. Our God is a God of miracles to Israel and Judah… and He still is today to us, and forever He will be. As you read through the passages, may your hearts be lifted up to the God of miracles.



## Monday

```
“He (Jehoshaphat) walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD.” – 1 Kings 22:43 (ESV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [1 Kings 22:41-53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+22%3A41-53&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. What kind of king was Jehoshaphat? What were some of Jehoshaphat’s accomplishments and failures?
2. King Jehosaphat “did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.” Examine the various areas of your life. Which area(s) require of you to “do what is right in the eyes of the Lord” even when it is unpopular with those around you? What does it mean specifically in each area? (see [Philippians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A27&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Tuesday

```
“So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. ‘Man of God,’ he begged, ‘please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!” – 2 Kings 1:13 (NIV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+kings+1&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. In times of trouble, Ahaziah turned to the wrong god. Who or where do you turn to in times of trouble? Is God always the first you turn to?
2. Ahaziah was judged as unfaithful in his covenant with the Lord. The Bible says there will be a Judgment Day ([Hebrews 9:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A27&version=ESV)) coming. When God judges your life, do you think He will deem you as being covenantally faithful? Why or why not?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Wednesday

```
“When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, ‘Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?’ ‘Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,’ Elisha replied.” – 2 Kings 2:9 (NIV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+2&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. In a tender moment, Elisha had the opportunity to ask for anything he desired. He chose to ask for more of God’s power. Would you have asked for the same thing? Why and why not? 
2. From that point on, Elisha would journey through his life without Elijah, but He would be standing on Elijah’s shoulders. Is there an individual in your life that has made a great impact in your life – you are standing on his/her shoulders today? Thank the Lord for the person and take some time to thank that person for the impact he/she has made in your life.

## Thursday

```
“But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?” – 2 Kings 3:11 (NIV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+3&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Examine verse 3. What was the sin of Jeroboam? (Refer to the article, “What Was the Sin of Jeroboam?” in the Additional Resources section)
2. God made a way for the armies of Israel, Judah and Edom when there seemed to be no way. Are you fighting a battle right now and you are feeling defeated? Write your prayer below asking God to deliver you. He is able! (see also [Luke 18:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+18%3A27&version=ESV), [Psalm 121](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+121&version=ESV), [Ephesians 6:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+6%3A10&version=ESV))

“And they ate and had some left, according to the Word of the Lord.” – 2 Kings 4:44 (ESV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+4&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. This passage highlights the miracles that God did through Elisha. Imagine yourself as one of the returning exiles during the time of Nehemiah. How would this passage encourage you / your faith in God during that time?
2. Recall a time when God intervened in your life to do something. What did you learn about Him through that experience?

## Saturday

```
“Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, ‘Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.’” - 2 Kings 5:15 (NIV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+5&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Elisha’s instructions were simple yet very difficult for a prideful man. Naaman had to overcome his pride in order to receive from the Lord. Reflect on your own life. In what area do you struggle with pride especially when it comes to following the Lord? And in what area are you depending too much on another person, rather than on God? 
2. God punished Gehazi through the words of Elisha. This passage shows us that we are ultimately accountable to God for all our actions, especially those that are hidden. How does this awareness affect the way you live?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Sunday

```
“And Elisha prayed, ‘Open his eyes, LORD, so that he may see.’ Then the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.” - 2 Kings 6:17 (NIV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 6:1-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+6%3A1-23&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Unlike Elisha, why was his servant unable to see into the spiritual realm? What spiritual principle can you learn that will comfort and encourage you when the things in your daily life seem overwhelming? (see also [2 Chronicles 20:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+20%3A15&version=ESV))
2. Elisha demonstrated grace and even love towards his enemies, even though they tried to capture him. Which teaching of Christ does this mirror? How can you apply it in your life? (see [Matthew 5:43-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A43-48&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
