# Week 19

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We continue our exploration of the Psalms of Ascent before embarking on a study of 1 Peter, in line with our pulpit series. As you read through the Psalms this week, may you observe the various postures that we should have as we approach God in worship. Our worship of God must be an outflow of a life that fears Him and walks in His ways. 



## Monday

```
“The LORD has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.” - Psalm 126:3 (NIV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms+126&version=ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms+126&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Many scholars believe that this Psalm describes the Israelites when they were set free from Babylonian captivity and allowed to return to Jerusalem. From the first 3 verses, what are some of the phrases/words used to describe how they felt?
2. Psalm 126 comes from a people who are living between a good time remembered and another good time hope for. What is one area you are hoping for God to intervene in? Write out your prayer asking for God’s intervention in that area.

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Tuesday

```
“Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in His ways!” - Psalm 128:1 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 128](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+128&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. According to this Psalm, how does the Lord bless those who fear Him and walk in His ways? What similarities do you see between these blessings and God’s first command to Adam and Eve in [Genesis 1:27-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27-28&version=ESV)?
2. A believer’s journey with the Lord is not without suffering and difficult circumstances, even though he/she fears the Lord and walks in His ways. How then should we define “blessed”? (Consider [Psalm 34:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3A8&version=ESV), [91:9-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91%3A9-11&version=ESV), [Matthew 5:3-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A3-12&version=ESV))

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 129](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+129&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. This Psalm is known as an imprecatory psalm, or one that invites or invokes judgment, evil or even some kind of curse on someone or something. List out the specific imprecations found in this Psalm.
2. King David was the author of far more imprecatory Psalms than anyone else. But ironically, David exhibited just the opposite of a vindictive or revengeful spirit in his own life. Why is that so? (see also [Romans 12:17-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A17-21&version=ESV))

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 131](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms+131&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. How do Christians commonly manifest the words “proud” and “haughty”? (see [1 Corinthians 8:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+8%3A1-2&version=ESV), [Psalm 20:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+20%3A7&version=ESV))
