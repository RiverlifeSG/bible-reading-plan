# Week 11

## This Week's Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

This week, we will explore the final chapters of Solomon’s end-of-life reflections in the book of Ecclesiastes. His conclusion for mankind is this – Fear God and keep His commandments… (Ecc. 12:13-14). The fear of the Lord is one topic that is hardly talked about in churches today. Many prefer to focus on the love and grace of God. Solomon, however reminds us of a coming reality that we will all stand before God who will judge us at the end of days. May the Lord ignite in you a desire to live for that which is eternal and not temporal! 



## Monday

“Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it.” – Ecclesiastes 7:12 (NIV)

### Today's Meditation

- Read [Ecclesiastes 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes+7&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
- “Wisdom is a shelter” that “preserves those who have it” (v.12). Review Ecclesiastes 7 and list down how wisdom is like a shelter that can preserve you in this day and age?
- Consider Solomon’s observations in v15. What should we expect of God with regards to what our life should look like ([refer also to Philippians 4:11-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4:11-13&version=ESV))?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
- Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
- Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Tuesday

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

“No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning.” – Ecclesiastes 8:17 (NIV)

### Today's Meditation

- Read [Ecclesiastes 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+8&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
- Reflect on v.6 and 11 again. Think about a time when injustice was done to you, but the perpetrator did not get his/her “just deserts”. How did you respond? What is the merit of leaving the matter into God’s hands and waiting upon Him? 
- Ecclesiastes 8 expounds that man cannot know God’s ways and never will. Instead, we should learn to accept what life brings our way (the good and the bad) and to enjoy the simple blessings (“eat and drink and be glad”). What is it in your life that you should learn to appreciate more?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
- Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.

## Wednesday

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

“All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean… As it is with the good, so with the sinful...” – Ecclesiastes 9:2 (NIV)

### Today's Meditation

- Read [Ecclesiastes 9:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A1-10&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
- If the same destiny (death) overtakes us all, why then do we strive to live Godly lives? Shouldn’t we live our lives the way we want and indulge ourselves in worldly pleasures? What should our perspective be as Christ followers? (Refer also to [Hebrews 9:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A27&version=ESV), [Matthew 6:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A33&version=ESV) and [Colossians 3:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A1-6&version=ESV))
- “For man does not know his time…” (v 12) How would you like people to remember you at the end of your life? How can you cultivate these characteristics?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
- Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
- Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

### Today's Meditation

- Read [Ecclesiastes 9:11 - 10:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A11-10%3A20&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

“Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see; but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.” – Ecclesiastes 11:9 (NIV)

### Today's Meditation

- Read [Ecclesiastes 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+11&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
- In verse 5, Solomon says that we do not know the works of God. On the other hand, we can know God’s ways through His Word. How then should you live your life?
- God gives us the freedom to do what we want (free will), but whatever we choose to do, it will all come under His judgment. How then do we align with God such that our heart posture and what we do is right in His sight?

### Today's Meditation

- Read [Ecclesiastes 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
- The conclusion to Ecclesiastes lies in v. 13-14. The foundation of wisdom is loving reverence (fear of the Lord). What does it mean to fear the Lord and keep His commandments?

### Reflection Questions
- Yesterday we touched on living a God-fearing life. Today’s reading tells us that the fear of the Lord produces wisdom. How does the fear of the Lord produce wisdom? 
- What is the difference between worldly knowledge and godly wisdom? Are there areas in your life which you believe are self-sufficient, and you have no need for “wisdom and instruction”?
