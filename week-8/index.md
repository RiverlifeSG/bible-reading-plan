# Week 8

![](./media/image5.jpg)

## This Week’s Focus

This week, we continue our readings on the theme of faith. In the New Testament, _faith_ (_Greek_: pistis) is always taught as a gift from God, and never something that can be produced by people. As you meditate on the various accounts of the heroes of faith in the Bible, may the Lord grant you a greater revelation of who He is, so that your faith can increase\! Have a blessed time in God’s Word.

## Monday

```
“…for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving by many or by few.” – 1 Samuel 14:6 (ESV)
```

### Today’s Meditation

1. Read [1 Samuel 14:1-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+14%3A1-15&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions

1. In 1 Sam 14:1, Jonathan and his armour bearer planned an attack on the Philistine army that defies common logic! How does one live in the tension of faith and logic? (Refer to [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=ESV), [Colossians 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A2&version=ESV), [2 Corinthians 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A7&version=ESV) and [Hebrews 11:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A6&version=ESV).

2. In 1 Sam 14:6, Jonathan tells his armour bearer that “nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.” What does this verse tell you about Jonathan’s view of God? How can the heart of this verse become a reality in your life?

## FRIDAY

```
“If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.” - Daniel 3:17-18 (ESV)

2. King Nebuchadnezzar was so astounded at the faith of Daniel’s three friends that he publicly acknowledged God’s greatness. How can you demonstrate faith in such a way that impacts the people you live with, work with, or go to school with?

2. Since the other rulers could not find any valid complaints against Daniel, what did they decide to use against him? What aspects in your lifestyle of faith would cause unease among unbelievers? How should you then relate to these unbelievers?
