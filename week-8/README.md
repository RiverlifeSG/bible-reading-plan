# This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

This week, we continue our readings on the theme of faith. In the New Testament, faith (Greek: pistis) is always taught as a gift from God, and never something that can be produced by people. As you meditate on the various accounts of the heroes of faith in the Bible, may the Lord grant you a greater revelation of who He is, so that your faith can increase! Have a blessed time in God’s Word.
