### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Psalm 37:1-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+37%3A1-19&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. The opening of Psalm 37 (ESV) says, “Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers!”. What does it mean for you to “fret” and be “envious of wrongdoers”? 
2. Reflect on v 8. What situation or who in your life should you stop trying to change and/or fix; but instead to trust and commit to the Lord, and wait upon Him? How will you start this process?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
