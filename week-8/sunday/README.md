### Today's Meditation
1. Read (Galatians 2:15 - 3:14)[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A15+-+3%3A14&version=ESV]


### Reflection Questions
1. What does it mean to be “crucified with Christ”? In this season, how are you living a life that declares “it’s no longer I who live but Christ lives in me” (v 20)? 
2. “The righteous shall live by faith…”? (v 11). In the context of this passage, what does it mean for you to live by faith?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
