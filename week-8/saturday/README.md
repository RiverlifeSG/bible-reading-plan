### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Daniel 6:1-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+6%3A1-23&version=ESV)

### Reflection Questions
1. Acording to this passage, how important is a life of integrity if one desires to exhibit a lifestyle of faith in an unbelieving world? Examine your life – are there areas that do not demonstrate integrity?
2. Since the other rulers could not find any valid complaints against Daniel, what did they decide to use against him? What aspects in your lifestyle of faith would cause unease among unbelievers? How should you then relate to these unbelievers?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
