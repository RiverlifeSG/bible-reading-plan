### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+14%3A1-15&version=ESV" target="_blank">1 Samuel 14:1-5</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. In 1 Sam 14:1, Jonathan and his armour bearer planned an attack on the Philistine army that defies common logic! How does one live in the tension of faith and logic? (Refer to [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=ESV), [Colossians 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A2&version=ESV), [2 Corinthians 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A7&version=ESV) and [Hebrews 11:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A6&version=ESV)) 
2. In 1 Sam 14:6, Jonathan tells his armour bearer that “nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.” What does this verse tell you about Jonathan’s view of God? How can the heart of this verse become a reality in your life? 

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
