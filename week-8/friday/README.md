### Week 8

## Friday

> “If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.” - Genesis 22:14 (ESV)

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Daniel 3:8-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+3%3A8-28&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Some Christians believe that if you have sufficient faith, deliverance will always follow. In light of vv 17-18, what is the correct approach towards having faith and expecting God’s deliverance?
2. King Nebuchadnezzar was so astounded at the faith of Daniel’s three friends that he publicly acknowledged God’s greatness. How can you demonstrate faith in such a way that impacts the people you live with, work with, or go to school with?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
