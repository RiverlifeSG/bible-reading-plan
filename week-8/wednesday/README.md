### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+27%3A1-14&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 27:1-14</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. David cites three big reasons why we need not fear. In what ways have you experienced the Lord as your “light,” “salvation,” and “stronghold”?
2. According to this Psalm, how should you respond when it seems that God is not answering your cries for help? (vv 11-14)


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
