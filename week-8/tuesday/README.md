### Today's Meditation
1. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+17%3A12-37&version=ESV" target="_blank">1 Samuel 17:12-37</a>


### Reflection Questions
1. Examine vv 26-28. What is the difference between David’s and Eliab’s character in terms of their faith?
2. David’s faith was based on the revelation of what God has done for him (v 37). What victory did Jesus win for us that we could not win for ourselves? How then should we live in light of this victory?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
