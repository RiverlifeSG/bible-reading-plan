# Week 23

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We will examine the topic of submission to authority. Submission is not a popular word today as it implies weakness. However, this is contrary to what Scripture teaches. In the Bible, submission is a sign of strength - best examplified in the life of Christ who though being equal with God Himself, submitted fully to the will of the Father. May you be reminded to posture your heart to emulate the submission of Christ as you read and ponder on this week’s readings.



## Monday

```
“For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority?” – Romans 13:3 (ESV)
