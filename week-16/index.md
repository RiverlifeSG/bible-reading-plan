# Week 16

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We come to the end of exploring how the nation of Israel landed up in exile. God’s Word through the prophet Micah was a warning to the idolatrous nation to turn from her ways. But sadly, Israel continued in her sin. As you read through the passages this week, may your spiritual ears be open to listen to God’s still small voice – calling you back to Him, especially those areas in your life that you have yet to surrender to Him.



## Monday

```
“You have indeed struck down Edom, and your heart has lifted you up.” – 2 Kings 14:10 (ESV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+14&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. What caused Amaziah’s heart to be lifted up and what was King Jehoash’s advice to him? (v 10-11) Recall a time in your life when your pride caused you to fall. What did you learn from that episode?
2. Verse 27 illustrates God’s faithfulness to His promises. Are there any prerequisites for us to receive all of God’s promises in His Word? (see [Joshua 1:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+1%3A3-8&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Tuesday

```
“Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away.” – 2 Kings 15:4 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 15:1-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+15%3A1-16&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Why do you think the various kings did not remove “the high places”? Refer to “What Were the High Places?” in Additional Resources. 
2. Today’s passage once again lists down the kings who did what was right and the kings who did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord. When you reach your last day on earth, imagine what your life would look like if you “did what was right in the eyes of the Lord”? What would it look like if you did what was “evil in the eyes of the Lord”?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Wednesday

```
“He did not depart all his days from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.” – 2 Kings 15:18 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 15:17-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+15%3A17-38&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. For every King that “did evil in the eyes of the Lord”, what was the common phrase that Scripture uses to describe what they did? Can you identify any unhealthy / sinful pattern(s) that have been passed down from previous generations in your family tree? Take some time to repent of these sinful patterns before the Lord. (see also “Understanding the Generational Curse of Exodus 34:7” in Additional Resources).
2. Very little was recorded about many of these kings as they had minimal impact on their kingdom. Identify 3 persons in your life that you would intentionally like to impact. Describe how you would like to do so.

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)

2. What do you think really matters to God when you worship Him?

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Amos 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=amos+3&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. What was God’s reason for punishing Israel? (vv 1-2)
2. God did not have to announce His judgment on Israel. Yet, He did so through the prophet Amos. Why do you think God’s judgment was proclaimed beforehand to Israel? How does this observation about God affect the way you live?

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Micah 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah+1&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Look at verse 9. Why was Micah lamentating and wailing?
2. By the time we reached the book of Nehemiah, the prophecy in verse 16 had already been fulfilled. What does it reveal about God’s character and how do you view God now?

### Reflection Questions
1. Who are the ones being judged in this passage? (vv 1-2, 11)
2. Examine verses 12-13. What ares God’s promises in these verses? Can you now see how it was fulfilled through Nehemiah? What have you discovered about God from this account?
