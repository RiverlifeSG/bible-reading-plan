# Week 17

## This Week’s Focus

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

We continue our examination of the proclamation of God’s judgement on the nations of Israel through the prophets Isaiah and Hosea. Despite their numerous warnings, Israel remained stubborn and unrepentant; leading to their ultimate exile. As you read through the Scriptures this week, may the Holy Spirit remind you of the importance of having an open and tender heart before Him.



## Monday

```
“‘Come now, let us reason together,’ says the Lord…” – Isaiah 1:18 (ESV)
```

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Isaiah 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+1&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Verses 1-9 show Israel’s failure to see the connection between an action and its consequences, and Israel’s refusal to recognise the boundaries set by God. Personal freedom is a right held firmly by many people today. As a believer, how firmly should we hold onto our personal freedom? (see also [1 Corinthians 10:23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A23-24&version=ESV), [31-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A31-33&version=ESV))
2. Verses 10-29 deal with the human tendency to use religious behaviour as a means of manipulating God for our own benefit. How then should we come before God in prayer for our needs? (see also [Philippians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A6&version=ESV), [Matthew 6:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A5-8&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Tuesday

```
“…because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord, defying His glorious presence.” - Isaiah 3:8 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Isaiah 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+3&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. In looking at the leadership of Judah, today’s passage highlights that arrogance produces humiliation. In what ways have you observed arrogance among Christians (yourself included)?
2. The central issue in chapter 3 is the desire of mankind to elevate oneself through wealth, education, power, beauty and religion. What drives that great desire among men to elevate oneself? How can we overcome it?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Wednesday

```
“For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.’” - Hosea 2:5 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Hosea 2:1-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+2%3A1-13&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. This passage outlines a series of accusations against an unfaithful wife and God’s responses towards Israel (His discipline of Israel). Similarly, how can we recognise God’s discipline in our lives? 
2. Examine verse 6. What is God’s purpose in obstucting a person’s way? What does it tell you about God’s ultimate purpose of His discipline?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Thursday

```
“Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land.” - Hosea 4:1 (NIV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [Hosea 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+4&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. God announces He has brought charges against His people in verses 1-3. What characterises covenant unfaithfulness from these verses?
2. In verses 11-14, Hosea describes how God rejects a syncretistic kind of worship - where the Israelites practiced culturally accepted worship rituals common in Canaanite temples, even though they feared God. In today’s context, what kind of worship would God accept? (see [Romans 12:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A1&version=ESV))

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)



## Friday

```
“And this occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God…” - 2 Kings 17:7 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 17:1-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+kings+17%3A1-23&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Verses 14-18 tell us that Israel was in exile because of idolatry. What exactly did Israel do that was described as “not believing in the Lord their God”? 
2. Judah was in exile because they had “walked in the customs that Israel had introduced.” (v 19) Are there “influencers” in your life that distract you from a thriving Christian life? How can you minimise their influence?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Saturday

```
“However, they would not listen, but they did according to their former manner.” - 2 Kings 17:40 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 17:24-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+17%3A24-41&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. Today’s reading implies God remains faithful to the relationship established by covenant. As a Christian, what does it mean for you to be “covenantally faithful”?
2. Israel was covenantally unfaithful because though they feared God, they also served their carved images (v 41). What “carved images” are there in your life that you need to stop serving?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)




## Sunday

```
“And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.” - 2 Kings 18:3 (ESV)
```

<img src="/assets/img/tree.png" style="width: 150px">

### Today's Meditation
1. Read [2 Kings 18:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+18%3A1-12&version=ESV)


### Reflection Questions
1. According to verse 7, what were the consequences of Hezekiah’s faithfulness to Israel’s covenenant with God? What are the blessings when we remain covenantally faithful to the Lord? (see also [Proverbs 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+2&version=ESV))
2. Verses 9-12 show the contrasting consequences of Israel because
“they neither listened nor obeyed.” (v 12) How can you increase your capacity to “listen and obey”? (see also [Proverbs 4:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+4%3A23&version=ESV), [27:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A6&version=ESV), [Revelation 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+3%3A20&version=ESV))
