### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 103</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. This Psalm begins and ends with a call to worship - to bless the Lord. The rest of the Psalm gives us the reason why. What are the characteristics of God listed in this Psalm that will cause us to worship Him?
2. This Psalm states that “the Lord does not deal with us according to our sin.” This is grace. Remember the times in your life when you have disappointed God through sin. Contrast that with the characteristics of God you just listed. Then, write a prayer to God thanking Him for His grace.


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
