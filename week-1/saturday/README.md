### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+51&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalm 51</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. Examine this famous Psalm again. What have you observed about King David’s prayer? Which parts of the Psalm do you resonate with the most?
2. “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” We all sin... but what matters is our posture. What does it mean for you to have a “broken spirit”?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
