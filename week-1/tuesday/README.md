### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+6%3A5-22&version=ESV" target="_blank">Genesis 6:5 - 22</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. Examine verses 5-6. Why do you think the great God of the universe was grieved to His heart by the sins of men? Shouldn’t this be an expected outcome as a result of the sin of Adam?
2. Noah took 120 years to build the ark before he saw the first drop of rain. As a result of his obedience, he found favour in God’s eyes. What areas in your life at this point of time require obedience?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
