### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+11&version=ESV" target="_blank">Psalms 11</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. Verse 4 says, “He observes everyone on earth; His eyes examine them.” In the light of this verse, does it matter how we live our lives? Does it matter what we do in public as well as in private, when no one else is watching?
2. Verse 7 states that, “...the Lord is righteous.” Why do you think the Lord hates sin so much? What implication does it have on how we should live?

### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
