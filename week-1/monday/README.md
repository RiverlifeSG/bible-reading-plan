### Today's Meditation
Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+1&version=NIV" target="_blank">Nehemiah 1</a>

### Reflection Questions

1. Put yourself in Nehemiah’s shoes. Why would an individual who was born in exile respond the way he did to the news of Jerusalem’s ruins? What are some possible factors leading to Nehemiah’s reaction?
2. As you look at our society today, what do you think are some things that break the heart of God? Rather than turning a blind eye to these things, how can you pray and stand in the gap on behalf of those who cannot tell between right and wrong?


### Speak, Lord... Your Servant is Listening
1. Areas of my life (character, lifestyle and values) the Holy Spirit is prompting me to adjust.
2. Any other promptings from the Holy Spirit? (Words of encouragement, specific actions, etc.)
